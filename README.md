# Scrivener-Wordcount-Tool
A tool that reads wordcounts for a given day and graphs them over time. Reads an entire folder (which makes it good for use with Scrivener)

There is one variable within wordcounter.py that will need to be altered in order for this project to work on one's computer:

Change 'project folder' (which, if you use scrivener, is the directory you should sync your project to)

Once you've done this, simply run wordcounter.py, and Word Grapher.py afterwards.

wordcounter.py records your wordcount (and the current date) for graphing later.

Word Grapher.py then produces a simple bargraph based on current wordcount records

Future editions of this wordcounter will include more detailed graphs
